***Using Horizontal Sampling Collection to Learn About Farmed Scallop eDNA***

**eDNA From Scallop Sea Farms**

For this portion of the study we started with the question: How does eDNA disperse from scallop sea farm sites (also known as aquaculture sites)? 

Unlike wild scallop populations that live on the ocean floor, sea farmers grow scallops in suspended cages or nets. 

These nets and cages come in many shapes and sizes, for example lantern nets (Image A) or racks, like the ones they use at Hurricane Island (Image B)!

**Creating Our Sampling Scheme**

Because these racks were suspended at a set depth near the surface, we wanted to see how scallop eDNA dispersed in the water as you moved further away from the racks. To do this, we designed a horizontal sampling scheme that you can see in Figure 2 Section B below. 

At the aquaculture site, horizontal water samples would be taken at exponentially greater distances starting at the racks. Our first sample would be collected at 1 m followed by 2 m, 4 m, 16 m, 32 m, 64 m, 128 m, and 256 m meters from the net (Figure 2). At each distance water samples would be collected in duplicate.

***Now that we had our plan we were ready to start collecting the supplies we would need in the field!***
