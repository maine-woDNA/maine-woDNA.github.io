***Using Horizontal Sampling Collection to Learn About Farmed Scallop eDNA***

**eDNA From Scallop Sea Farms**

For this portion of the study we started with the question: How does eDNA disperse from scallop sea farm sites (also knowns as aquaculture sites)? 

Unlike wild scallop populations that live on the ocean floor, sea farmers grow scallops in suspended cages or nets. 

These nets and cages come in many shapes and sizes, for example lantern nets (Image A) or racks, like the ones they use at Hurricane Island (Image B)!

Because these racks were suspended at a set depth near the surface, we wanted to see how scallop eDNA dispersed in the water as you moved further away from the racks. To do this, we designed a horizontal sampling scheme that you can see in Figure 2 below.

**Getting to Our Site**

**Water Collection**

Once we arrived at the sea farm off Hurrican Island, we were ready to collect some water! To do this we use a collection bottle called a Niskin (see image below). 

A Niskin bottle is an ocean-water sampler used to collect water at a desired depth without mixing with water from other depths. The bottle itself is made of a long plastic cylinder with openings at both ends. These openings can be fully sealed with stoppers to capture water samples. When a Niskin is deployed, the stoppers are held open by elastic chords connected to a release mechanism. Once the Niskin is at the correct depth, the researchers send a weight, known as a messenger, down the rope that is attached to the Niskin. When the messenger collides with the Niskin it triggers the release mechanism, releasing the elastic chords and causing both stoppers to close--capturing the water sample.

Steps:
-cleaning and labeling bottles
-cleaning niskin
-deploying niskin
-putting water in bottles: rinsing, filling to 1L (next page) 
-putting in cooler (next page)


***Check Your Knowledge***

Time to check your knowledge! Your bottles are cleaned, labeled, and safely stored on the boat with you. You have just collected your first 1 L sample at 1 m from the site. Referring back to your sampling scheme (Figure 2) what do you need to do next?

A. Re-deploy your Niskin to collect your replicate (second sample) at 1 m.
B. Thoroughly clean your Niskin with 10% bleach and DI and collect your next sample at 16 m away from the site.
C. Rinse your Niskin with surface water and collect your next sample at 2 m.
