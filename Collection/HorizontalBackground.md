**Using Horizontal Sampling Collection to Learn About Farmed Scallop eDNA**

For this portion of the study we started with the question: How does eDNA disperse from scallop sea farm (also knowns as aquaculture) sites? 

Unlike wild scallop populations that live on the ocean floor, sea farmers grow scallops in suspended cages or nets. 

These nets and cages come in many shapes and sizes, for example lantern nets (Image A) or racks, like the ones they use at Hurricane Island (Image B)!
