***Using Horizontal Sampling Collection to Learn About Farmed Scallop eDNA***

**eDNA From Scallop Sea Farms**

For this portion of the study we started with the question: How does eDNA disperse from scallop sea farm sites (also known as aquaculture sites)? 

Unlike wild scallop populations that live on the ocean floor, sea farmers grow scallops in suspended cages or nets. 

These nets and cages come in many shapes and sizes, for example lantern nets (Image A) or racks, like the ones they use at Hurricane Island (Image B)!

**Why It Matters**

As we mentioned before, Maine scallops are unique because there are both strong wild populations that are commercially harvested and a developing scallop aquaculture industry. As a result, fisheries managers are tasked with the challenge of simultaneously managing both wild capture and farmed fisheries. In order to manage effectively, managers need information on the status of scallop stocks. To understand stocks, managers first need accurate data on scallop recruitment dynamics and the possible exchange between wild and aquaculture populations.

One way to explore recruitment dynamics and population exchange is to look at scallop larvae. However, this can be challenging for scallops because their microscopic gametes and larvae cannot be distinguished from other bivalves, and are difficult to track (Pechenik, 1999). eDNA is a tool that can help inform how we understand larval supply and dispersal and how it might affect scallop stocks. 

eDNA approaches may help to disentangle where and how many larvae will disperse. This information could allow managers to estimate recruitment and the degree of connectivity between populations. However, in order to design the most effective scallop larvae eDNA experiment, we need more information about where larvae are in the water column and how far away the larvae can be detected from the adult populations. 

With this information, we could carefully design our experiment so that we are sampling at the right depth and right distance to understand scallop stocks. Improving eDNA scallop sampling techniques will not only help us understand scallop recruitment, larvae, and adult populations, but will also support including eDNA methods as a tool for fisheries managment.

**Creating Our Sampling Scheme**

Because the scallop racks at Hurricane Island were suspended at a set depth near the surface, we wanted to see how scallop eDNA dispersed in the water as you moved horizontally away from the racks. To do this, we designed a horizontal sampling scheme that you can see in Figure 2 Section B below. 

At the aquaculture site, horizontal water samples would be taken at exponentially greater distances starting at the racks. Our first sample would be collected at 1 m followed by 2 m, 4 m, 16 m, 32 m, 64 m, 128 m, and 256 m meters from the net (Figure 2). At each distance water samples would be collected in duplicate. 

Two negative controls would be collected at the site after completing sampling to test for contamination.

With this sampling design in hand, we were ready to move onto the next step of our experiment!

***Now that we had our plan we were ready to start collecting the supplies we would need in the field!***    






***CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE***

Time to check your knowledge! Based on our experimental design, how many total horizontal samples will we collect?

**A.** 16 samples and 2 controls.

**B.** 8 samples and 2 controls. 

**C.** 8 samples and 8 controls.
