***Using Horizontal Sampling Collection to Learn About Farmed Scallop eDNA***

**eDNA From Scallop Sea Farms**

For this portion of the study we started with the question: How does eDNA disperse from scallop sea farm sites (also knowns as aquaculture sites)? 

Unlike wild scallop populations that live on the ocean floor, sea farmers grow scallops in suspended cages or nets. 

These nets and cages come in many shapes and sizes, for example lantern nets (Image A) or racks, like the ones they use at Hurricane Island (Image B)!

Because these racks were suspended at a set depth near the surface, we wanted to see how scallop eDNA dispersed in the water as you moved further away from the racks. To do this, we designed a horizontal sampling scheme that you can see in Figure 2 below.

**Getting to Our Site**

Will this be covered in the background? 




**What is a Niskin?**

Once we arrived at the sea farm off Hurricane Island, we were ready to collect some water! To do this we used a collection bottle called a Niskin (see image below). 

A Niskin bottle is an ocean-water sampler used to collect water at a desired depth without mixing with water from other depths. The bottle itself is made of a long plastic cylinder with openings at both ends. These openings can be fully sealed with stoppers to capture water samples. When a Niskin is deployed, the stoppers are held open by elastic cords connected to a release mechanism. Once the Niskin is at the correct depth, the researchers send a weight, known as a messenger, down the rope that is attached to the Niskin. When the messenger collides with the Niskin it triggers the release mechanism, releasing the elastic chords and causing both stoppers to close--capturing the water sample.

**Using a Niskin to Collect eDNA Water Samples**

We used Niskins to collect our horizontal water samples at the scallop sea farm site. To do this, we followed a collection protocol made up of the following steps: 

*Step 1: Cleaning the Niskin*    

Before we used the Niskin to collect eDNA water samples it had to be cleaned. Cleaning allowed us to be sure that there was no foreign DNA that would contaminate our sample or that we wouldn't cause cross-contamination between sites. To clean the Niskin we sprayed it with a solution of 10% bleach followed by three rinses of tap water. We cleaned inside the Niskin and both stopper ends thoroughly.

*Step 2: Preparing the Niskin*   
Next we had to prepare the Niskin for deployment. To do this, we first attached the Niskin to our line. We then opened both stoppers by attaching the elastics to the release mechanism. Lastly we made sure the Niskin valve, the small white valve that helps water flow freely out of the Niskin, was closed.

Attaching the Niskin to our line:

Opening the stoppers and attaching the elastic to the release mechanism. The white valve is closed:

*Step 3: Deploying the Niskin*   
We then deployed the Niskin by lowering it into the water. Our line had a heavy weight at the bottom that helped the Niskin sink. Once tossed overboard, we slowly lowered the Niskin into the water.

Toss it overboard:

And down it goes:

*Step 4: Capturing the Sample*    
Finally, we triggered the release mechanism by sending the weight, or messenger, down our line. Once the messenger collided with the Niskin it released the stoppers and sealed our water sample. We then pulled up our line and brought our Niskin onboard!

***Check Your Knowledge***

Time to check your knowledge! You are at your first sampling location at 1 m away from the sea farm site and you are getting your Niskin ready for deployment. What is the last step you need to do before putting it in the water?

**A.** Attach the elastic to the release mechanism, and make sure that both stoppers are open and that the valve is closed.         
**B.** Thoroughly clean your Niskin with 10% bleach and one rinse of tap water.      

**C.** Attach your Niskin to your line and make sure your stoppers and tightly sealed.
