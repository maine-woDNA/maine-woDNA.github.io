***SAMPLING SUPPLIES***

Before heading out to Hurricane Island, we needed a number of supplies to help us collect, store, and safely transport our water samples back to the lab. 

Our supply list included:

**Niskin Bottles**

*What is a Niskin?*

A Niskin bottle is an ocean-water sampler used to collect water at a desired depth without mixing with water from other depths. The bottle itself is made of a long plastic cylinder with openings at both ends. These openings can be fully sealed with stoppers to capture water samples. When a Niskin is deployed, the stoppers are held open by elastic cords connected to a release mechanism. Once the Niskin is at the correct depth, the researchers send a weight, known as a messenger, down the rope that is attached to the Niskin. When the messenger collides with the Niskin it triggers the release mechanism, releasing the elastic chords and causing both stoppers to close--capturing the water sample.
