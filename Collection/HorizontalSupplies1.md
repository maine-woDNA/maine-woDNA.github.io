***SAMPLING SUPPLIES***

Before heading out to Hurricane Island, we needed a number of supplies to help us collect, store, and safely transport our water samples back to the lab. 

Our supply list included:

**Niskin Bottles**

*What is a Niskin?*

A Niskin bottle is an ocean-water sampler used to collect water at a desired depth without mixing with water from other depths. The bottle itself is made of a long plastic cylinder with openings at both ends. These openings can be fully sealed with stoppers to capture water samples. When a Niskin is deployed, the stoppers are held open by elastic cords connected to a release mechanism. Once the Niskin is at the correct depth, the researchers send a weight, known as a messenger, down the rope that is attached to the Niskin. When the messenger collides with the Niskin it triggers the release mechanism, releasing the elastic chords and causing both stoppers to close--capturing the water sample. 

We brought along two Niskin bottles for our sampling.

**Lines with Depth Marks**  

We needed ropes or lines to attach to our Niskin for deployment. Marking these ropes with certain measurements, say a mark every 2 meters, helped us know that our Niskin was at the correct depth. 


**Cleaning Supplies**  

In all eDNA research, it is incredibly important to make sure that all equipment is clean and does not have any foreign DNA. To decontaminate our gear we used a solution of 10% bleach and water for rinsing (many researchers prefer deionized [DI] water or Milli-Q water for rinsing).


**1 L Sample Bottles**  

We also needed something to store our samples in! For this, we used clean, 1 L sample bottles. We labeled the bottles on the ferry on the way to Hurricane Island to make sure that they were all ready to go for our sampling.

**Water for Controls** 

We also needed water to use for our controls to test for contamination in our sampling process. Be brought along a big container of tap water to do the job.

**Coolers with Ice** 

Finally, we needed a way to keep our water samples cool and away from light on the trip back to the lab. To do this, we brought along large coolers filled with ice. After each sample bottle was filled they were placed safely into the coolers.

***CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE***

Time to check your knowledge! Before I leave for my sampling I need to make sure I have which things?

**A.** Niskin, line, cleaning supplies, water for controls, pre-labeled sampling bottles, cooler and ice.

**B.** Niskin, line, cleaning supplies, cooler and ice, lots of snacks.   

**C.** Niskin, line, cleaning supplies, water for controls, a fun hat.
