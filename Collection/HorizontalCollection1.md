**Nicely done!**

Once we had all of our supplies together we were ready to go!


**Getting to Our Site**  

We then got on Captain Jason's boat and cruised on over to Hurricane Island. We located our sampling site at Hurricane's aquaculture aread and got right to work.

**Using a Niskin to Collect eDNA Water Samples**

We used Niskins to collect our horizontal water samples at the scallop sea farm site. To do this, we followed a collection protocol made up of the following steps: 

***Step 1: Cleaning the Niskin***    

Before we used the Niskin to collect eDNA water samples it had to be cleaned. Cleaning allowed us to be sure that there was no foreign DNA that would contaminate our sample and would ensure that we did not cause cross-contamination between sites. To clean the Niskin we sprayed it with a solution of 10% bleach followed by three rinses of tap water. We cleaned inside the Niskin and both stopper ends thoroughly after collecting our 2 replicates at each site.

***Step 2: Preparing the Niskin***   

Next we had to prepare the Niskin for deployment. To do this, we first attached the Niskin to our line. We then opened both stoppers by attaching the elastics to the release mechanism. Lastly we made sure the Niskin valve, the small white valve that helps water flow freely out of the Niskin, was closed.

***Step 3: Deploying the Niskin***   

We then deployed the Niskin by lowering it into the water. Our line had a heavy weight at the bottom that helped the Niskin sink. Once tossed overboard, we slowly lowered the Niskin into the water.

*Tossing it overboard:*

*And down it goes:*

***Step 4: Capturing the Sample***    

Finally, we triggered the release mechanism by sending the weight, or messenger, down our line. Once the messenger collided with the Niskin it released the stoppers and sealed our water sample. We then pulled up our line and brought our Niskin onboard!

***Step 5: Logging Data & Taking Notes***

Each step of the way we kept track of our progress and made sure to take notes on anything that might be important for our later analysis. 

*Marking things down in the field log:*

***CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE***

Time to check your knowledge! You are at your first sampling location at 1 m away from the sea farm site and you are getting your Niskin ready for deployment. What is the last step you need to do before putting it in the water?

**A.** Attach the elastic to the release mechanism, and make sure that both stoppers are open and that the valve is closed.   

**B.** Thoroughly clean your Niskin with 10% bleach and one rinse of tap water.      

**C.** Attach your Niskin to your line and make sure your stoppers are tightly sealed.
