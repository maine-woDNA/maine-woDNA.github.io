***Using Vertical Sampling Collection to Learn About Wild Scallop eDNA***

**eDNA From Wild Scallop Beds**

For this portion of the study we started with the question: How does eDNA disperse from wild scallop beds? 

Unlike aquaculture scallop populations that are suspended in cages or lantern nets, wild scallop populations live on the sea floor. As a result, how we sample for aquaculture scallops will be different than how we sample for wild scallops.

**Why It Matters**

As we mentioned before, Maine scallops are unique because there are both strong wild populations that are commercially harvested and a developing scallop aquaculture industry. As a result, fisheries managers are tasked with the challenge of simultaneously managing both wild capture and farmed fisheries. In order to manage effectively, managers need information on the status of scallop stocks. To understand stocks, managers first need accurate data on scallop recruitment dynamics and the possible exchange between wild and aquaculture populations.

One way to explore recruitment dynamics and population exchange is to look at scallop larvae. However, this can be challenging for scallops because their microscopic gametes and larvae cannot be distinguished from other bivalves, and are difficult to track (Pechenik, 1999). eDNA is a tool that can help inform how we understand larval supply and dispersal and how it might affect scallop stocks. 

eDNA approaches may help to disentangle where and how many larvae will disperse. This information could allow managers to estimate recruitment and the degree of connectivity between populations. However, in order to design the most effective scallop larvae eDNA experiment, we need more information about where larvae are in the water column and how far away the larvae can be detected from the adult populations. 

With this information, we could carefully design our experiment so that we are sampling at the right depth and right distance to understand scallop stocks. Improving eDNA scallop sampling techniques will not only help us understand scallop recruitment, larvae, and adult populations, but will also support including eDNA methods as a tool for fisheries managment.

**Creating Our Sampling Scheme**

Because the wild scallop bed at Hurricane Island were on the ocean floor, we wanted to see how scallop eDNA dispersed in the water as you moved vertically away from the beds. To do this, we designed a vertical sampling scheme that you can see in the figure below. 

At the wild scallop bed, vertical water samples would be taken at uniform distances starting above the bed. We chose to sample every 3 meters. Our first sample would be collected at 20 m followed by 17 m, 14 m, 11 m, 8 m, 5 m, 2m, and 0.1 m, essentially at the surface. Water samples would be collected in duplicate for each depth. 

Two negative controls would be collected at the site after completing sampling to test for contamination.

With this sampling design in hand, we were ready to move onto the next step of our experiment!

***Now that we had our plan we were ready to start collecting the supplies we would need in the field!***    






***CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE***

Time to check your knowledge! Based on our experimental design, how many total horizontal samples will we collect?

**A.** 8 samples and 2 controls. 

**B.** 16 samples and 2 controls.

**C.** 8 samples and 8 controls.
