We can have a blurb about what eDNA is here! we can include images and other things (like a video embedded if we want!) as well. 

But since we dont have much text right now im just going to keep typing so it looks like there is. I am currently drinking a lovely glass of red wine. it is monday night and raining. so perfect for a glass. 


okay. this is enough of an example. we can even have subheaders and talk about the steps of an eDNA experiment here if we wanted to. And example can be seen below:

## Steps to conduct an eDNA experiment

### Collection

We talk about collecting edna!

### Extraction

We talk about extraction!

### Amplification

We talk about amplification! for qPCR or metagenomics

### Analysis

We talk about the analysis of qPCR or sequencing data!
