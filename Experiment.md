title: Let's Start the Experiment!
excerpt: Testing out an excerpt. can we talk about scallops here? are buttons able to be added or should i use home layout for that? It looks like buttons are okay! So does that mean that if i add a longer excerpt that the title will move up on the page or the excerpt will move down?
