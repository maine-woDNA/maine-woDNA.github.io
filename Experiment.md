### Intro to Sea Scallop Biology and Ecology

Our species of study is the Atlantic sea scallop whose scientific name is Placopecten magellanicus. Sea scallops are an invertebrate in the Phylum Mollusca and the Class Bivalvia, meaning they have two shells! Their two shells are held together by the adductor muscle, which is the part that you might have eaten before, AND this muscle also helps them to swim to escape predators and move to new habitat as young. They feed by filtering phytoplankton and other small organisms out of the water column which can improve water quality. Wild scallops live on sandy bottom and shell hash habitats in deep, cold waters from Newfoundland to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. They reproduce by spitting their gametes (eggs and sperm) into the water column, a process known as broadcast spawning. If eggs are fertilized, they become negatively buoyant and fall to the bottom until they hatch into larvae ~24 hours later. The resulting larvae then spend 35+ days being transported throughout the water column in the currents of the ocean before settling out on the bottom as baby scallops, or spat. This spawning takes place seasonally, usually in the late summer or early Fall (September).

### Intro to Scallop Fishery

The sea scallop federal fishery is the largest and most valuable wild scallop fishery in the world and among the most lucrative federal fisheries in the U.S., generating \$507 million in commercial landings in 2017 (NOAA, 2021). In coastal Maine, the state scallop fishery generated \$33.5M from 2015-2019 for the state and demands one of the highest state average prices per meat pound (~\$10.40/lb in 2019; DMR). In the wild fishery, scallops are caught using dredges deployed from a fishing vessel (watch a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3VRnUOE8dA)) or they are collected by divers using SCUBA (watch a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI99P43N6fk)). 


### Intro to Scallop Aquaculture

Scallops are unique among their bivalve counterparts in Maine in that they have a strong wild population and commercial harvest and now there is a scallop aquaculture industry developing in parallel. Aquaculture is the process of growing plants or animals in water, marine or fresh, for food. Most scallops are grown in lantern nets, multi-tiered nets that hang vertically in the water column from lines about 20 feet below the surface. Farmers catch the wild spat (baby scallops, from above) by deploying “spat bags” on lines in the water column. These lines are deployed in the Fall and retrieved in the Spring and then the spat are sorted out and put into lantern nets to grow!

So, now we have aquaculture farms and wild scallop populations co-located along the coast of Maine! This is a unique opportunity to explore potential interactions between wild and aquaculture scallop populations, specifically impacts on larval supply. This experiment evaluates the distribution of scallop eDNA vertically from wild scallop beds and horizontally from aquaculture lantern nets on Hurricane Island. The vertical and horizontal distribution study expands our understanding of scallop eDNA by relating gene copy number to presumed shed DNA in the water column over wild beds and next to lantern nets. With this data, we will be able to identify the best sampling depth and distance range to relate gene copy number to scallop density in the future. Accurately identifying distribution of scallop eDNA in the water column and further developing these eDNA techniques as they relate to scallop concentration will improve the efficiency of field studies and allow proper integration of eDNA as a tool for fisheries management.

The questions we’re asking are:
- How does the vertical distribution of scallop eDNA change with increasing distance above a wild scallop bed?
- How does the horizontal distribution of scallop eDNA change with increasing distance from a scallop aquaculture site?

Knowing that adults live on the bottom, we expect that the signal of scallop eDNA will decrease with increasing vertical distance from a wild bed. Knowing lantern nets are suspended in the water column, we expect that the signal of scallop eDNA will also decrease with increasing horizontal distance from a scallop aquaculture site.
