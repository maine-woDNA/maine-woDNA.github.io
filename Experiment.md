This is where we can have background info on scallops, wild beds vs lantern nets, etc. We can have images of what each of those may look like, or drawings! 

Look at this cool video!!

<p align="center">
<video width="400" controls>
  <source src="/assets/videos/Scallop.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video> </p>

Hmm what about with no size tags?
<p align="center">
<video controls>
  <source src="/assets/videos/Scallop.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video> </p>

There can be a lot of info here... similar to as if you just did the background work and summarized it.

Maybe it was the colon that made it unhappy?

Or if we wanted, buttons could be added not in the header but below the reading! (so you kinda have to read, though also maybe not)

does making the buttons a table change anything? center them? hmm what about center tag? im still thinking it may be old and broken in some places... div align center? womp. no cetnering buttons at the moment maybe now? with p align?

Markdown buttons - cant get to be centered

[Horizontal Distribution from Lantern Nets](#){:.button.button--outline-primary.button--pill}  [Vertical Distrubtion from Wild Scallop Beds](#){:.button.button--outline-primary.button--pill}


Html buttons - centered? hmm now?

<p align="center">
<a class="button button--outline-primary button--pill" href="horizontal/horizontal1">Horizontal Distribution from Lantern Nets</a> <a align="center" class="button button--outline-primary button--pill" href="vertical/vertical1">Vertical Distribution from Wild Scallop Beds</a> </p>
