Our project takes us to Hurricane Island in Penobscot Bay (Pen Bay), Maine! Pen Bay starts from the mouth of Maine's Penobscot River at it's Northern end and opens out to the Gulf of Maine at its Southern end.

There are many working waterfronts within Pen Bay and it is a world-renowned sailing destination. Specifically, our project takes place in the waters near Hurricane Island in the Fox Islands Archipelago within Penobscot Bay.

The 125-acre island is approximately 10 miles offshore from Rockland and is situated at the confluence of the Eastern Maine and Western Maine Coastal Currents. The discharge from the Penobscot River to the north of the island forms a gradient of estuarine and marine habitat. To the southwest, the western Maine coastal current causes water stratification and a zone of upwelling that affects the local ecology.

This project also partners with the Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership (Hurricane). Hurricane is a 501c3 non-profit with a mission to integrate science education, applied research, and leadership development through year-round educational programs and a seasonal sustainable Island community.

Hurricane manages a 3.2-acre research aquaculture farm to the north of the island where they grow scallops for research purposes. Partnering with other Penobscot Bay aquaculture farms on North Haven and Stonington, they have been monitoring gonado-somatic indices (GSI) and growth rates of aquaculture scallops across Penobscot Bay. Concurrently, they are monitoring GSIâ€™s and population structure in wild scallop populations around Hurricane and the Lower Penobscot Bay rotational management area, which supports a healthy commercial scallop fishery.
