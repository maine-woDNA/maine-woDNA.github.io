**Filtering eDNA Water Samples**

In order to capture eDNA from water samples, the water must be passed through a filter. Water samples can be filtered in the field or can be taken back to the lab for filtration. Filtering equipment usually comes in two types: cartrige filters (a closed filter) and glass fiber-type (either open or disk) filters. Water filterning can either be done manually (think: a hand pump) or mechanically with a motorized vacuum filtration system. No matter which route you take, filtration is how we capture eDNA before extraction.
