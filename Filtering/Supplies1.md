***FILTERING SUPPLIES***

Before we could filter our water samples, we needed a number of supplies. 

Our supply list included:


**Our Filtering Rig**   

We used a motorized vacuum pump to filter our samples. The pump helped to pull water, poured into the rigs sample cups, quickly through the filters. 

*Our filtering set-up:*

**Forceps**

Clean forceps to help place the filters and remove and store the filters in the vials when the filtering is complete.

**Filters**

For this study we used 0.22 Î¼m Supor filters.     



**Storage Vials**

Plastic vials with caps were used to safely store our filters.                    





***CLEANING OUR SUPPLIES & WORK STATION***   

With any DNA labwork it is essential that your lab bench or work station is clean. To do this sprayed the surface first with 96% ethanol, a 10% bleach solution, followed by a rinse of Milli-Q water. (Rene is this correct?)

We also cleaned all of the supplies that we would be using for filtration, including the cups for the filtering rig, the filter bases, and our forceps. We cleaned these supplies with a 10% bleach solution followed by rinsing three times with Milli-Q water.

***CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE***

Time to check your knowledge! When cleaning our lab bench or work station we should...

**A.** Clean with ethanol, 10% bleach, and rinse with Milli-Q water. 

**B.** Clean with 10% bleach and rinse with DI Water.
