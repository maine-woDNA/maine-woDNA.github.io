**Let's Filter Our Water Samples**

Once we had our lab bench clean and supplies ready to go, we could begin filtering. To do this, we followed a filtration protocol made up of the following steps: 


***Step 1: Retrieve Water Samples***    

We first retrieved our water samples from storage.

***Step 2: Check Filtration Rig*** 

We then checked our vacuum filtration rig to see if everything was properly set up and that we had all the supplies we would need.

***Step 3: Measure Water Samples*** 

Next, we measured out our water samples so that we knew that we were filtering 1 L per sample.

***Step 4: Place Filters*** 

Then we placed our filters on the filtering rig. We use .22 Î¼m Supor filters installed in 47 mm, in-line filter holders (Pall Laboratory). 

*Placing the filters on the rig:*

***Step 5: Add Water*** 

Once the filters we placed and the sample cups securely put back in place, we filled the cups with our water samples.

***Step 6: Adding Water*** 

Finally, we turned the vacuum on and let the filtering begin!

***CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE***

Time to check your knowledge! Why do we need to measure out the sample water before we filter, rather than just pouring directly from the bottles?

**A.** We didn't measure the water--pouring directly from the sample bottles is faster.

**B.** So that we know we are filtering a uniform amount for each sample. 

**C.** To avoid contamination from the outside of our sample bottles.
