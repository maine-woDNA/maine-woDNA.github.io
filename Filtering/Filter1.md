**Let's Filter Our Water Samples**

Once we had our lab bench clean and supplies ready to go, we could begin filtering. To do this, we followed a filtration protocol made up of the following steps: 

Prior to eDNA filtration and extraction, all laboratory equipment was cleaned with 10% bleach followed by triplicate rinses of Milli-Q water. The duplicate 1 Liter samples were vacuum filtered through .22 μm Supor filters installed in 47 mm, in-line filter holders (Pall Laboratory). The filters were then rolled and stored in 5mL eppendorf tubes at -20˚C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy PowerWater Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA yield was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer and the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay (Invitrogen).
