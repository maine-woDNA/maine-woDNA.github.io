**Storing Our Filters**
 
Once the filtering was complete, we performed the following steps to store the filters:
 
 
 **STEP 1: Label Tubes**
 
Before filtration, we pre-labeled our storage tubess. We used 5mL eppendorf tubes.        
 
 *Labeling tubes beforehand:*

 **STEP 2: Remove Filters**
 
Using two clean forceps, we removed the filter and folded it up into a loose roll. It helps to leave the filter on the filter stand as you roll.

**STEP 3: Store Tubes**

We then placed the rolled filters into the tubes and closed the lids. We placed the tubes on a rack and put them in a -20˚C freezer until DNA extraction.
