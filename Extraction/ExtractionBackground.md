**What is eDNA Extraction?**

Extraction is the step in which DNA is removed from cells and made accessible for analysis.      


**How Does Extraction Work?**

**1.** First, you must break open, or lyse, the cells containing the DNA. There are various methods to break down any membranes or cell walls containing the DNA, and range from sonicating, to bead beating, and the use of detergents.    

**2.** DNA proteins can be further broken down with the addition of a protease (an enzyne that degrades proteins). Other materials like salt (such as ammonium or sodium acetate) will help the proteins precipitate. Centrifuging and vortexing with phenol-chloroform further assists in separating out the DNA proteins.

**3.** The DNA is then mixed with ethanol or isopropanol and centrifuged. The alcohol helps to precipitate the DNA and helps to remove the added salt.

**4.** The DNA then forms a pellet this is washed with alcohol and centrifuged again.

**5.** After the alocohol is poured off, the DNA can be resuspended in  a buffer.
