**What is eDNA Extraction?**

Extraction is the step in which DNA is removed from cells, purified from other proteins and organelles, and made accessible for analysis. DNA extractions can be completed through a variety of different protocols. One common method is to use a kit that is produced by a biotechnology company. These kits come with the buffers and reagents needed to complete the extraction, as well as small supplies (such as collection tubes) needed. For this experiment, we used the Qiagen DNeasey PowerWater Kit.


**How Does Extraction With the Qiagen DNeasy PowerWater Kit Work?**

**1.** First, you must break open, or lyse, the cells containing the DNA and remove them from the filter membrane. The DNeasy PowerWater kit uses buffers as well as bead beating to mechanically lyse the cells and remove any proteins that may inhibit your ability to further process and analyze your samples. This step relies on vortexing your samples. Continue reading to learn more about what a vortexer is.    

**2.** The kit then uses columns to collect the DNA. Columns are small inserts that fit into standard sized sample tubes. They have a small surface area that collects and concentrates your DNA. Once on the surface of the column, the DNA is then washed with buffers such as ethanol. This step relies on a centrifuge to spin your samples down. To learn more about what a centrifuge is, continue reading!

**3.** The final step of the DNA extraction is to elute your DNA. When you elute your DNA you remove it from the column's surface by adding the final reagent your DNA will be stored in. This reagent (often either water or a buffer to stabilize your DNA) will absorb your DNA from the column surface and bring it into your final collection tube. 




**Instruments Used in Extraction**


***Vortexer***

A vortexer is a laboratory instrument that shakes your samples at a high speed. You use this machine when you want to thoroughly mix your samples. Below is a short video of what it looks like when you "bead-beat" your samples. In each tube, our sample is on the rolled up filter, and there is buffer as well as very small beads that are using the velocity of the vortexer to mechanically hit the filter and remove the DNA from the surface.

***Centrifuge***

A centrifuge is a laboratory instrument that spins in a circle extremely fast and uses centrifugal force to move your sample to the bottom of the tube it is in. The centrifuge is used when you want to collect your sample at the bottom of the tube, when you have buffer loaded on the surface of your column and want it to be pulled through the column, or when you have a substrate in your tube that you want collected at the bottom of your sample tube. In the video below, we are loading the centrifuge to collect particulates at the bottom of our sample tube.
