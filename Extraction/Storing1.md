**Storing the eDNA Extractions**    

Once our samples were extracted and measured via the qubit, we placed them in the -20 degree freezer for proper storage. The cold temperature prevents our samples from degrading over a long period of time. 

*Samples safely stored:*

**Choose the sampling scheme you selected at the start of the experiment to continue on to qPCR!**
