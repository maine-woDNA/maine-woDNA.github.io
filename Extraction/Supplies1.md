***EXTRACTION SUPPLIES***

We previously went over the major steps of a DNA extraction and what laboratory instruments are required to have to perform the extraction. However, let's go through all the supplies we need on hand to extract DNA. Let's look through our list below!

**PPE & Cleaning Supplies**

When working with DNA, we needed to make sure that other DNA (including ours) was not contaminating the samples. To do this, we cleaned all surfaces with 10% bleach, followed by 75% ethanol, then rinsed with Milli-Q water. Throughout the entire process, we wore nitrile gloves to prevent our own hands from contaminating our important samples.

**Extraction Kit**   

For extraction, we used a DNeasy PowerWater Kit. This kit came with all the necessary 1-time use supplies needed to perform the extraction (such as buffers and collection tubes).

**Micropipettes**

We also needed micropipettes and pipette tips to accurately measure and dispense the reagents and samples used in the extraction process. 

*Micropipettes come in different sizes that correspond with the volumes they can measure:*

**Labeling Supplies**  

Finally, we needed to label the tubes we used to hold our samples throughout the extraction process, as well as the final tubes our samples were stored in.

***CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE***

Time to check your knowledge! Before we begin extracting we need to make sure we have which things?

**A.** A complete extraction kit, micropipettes, labeling supplies, and your laboratory instruments on hand.

**B.**  A complete extraction kit, micropipettes, micropipette tips, gloves, cleaning supplies, labeling supplies, and your laboratory instruments on hand.

**C.** A complete extraction kit, micropipettes, micropipette tips, labeling supplies, and a really messy lab bench.
