**Let's Extract Our DNA Samples**

Now that we have all our supplies to extract our DNA, let's get down to business!

***Step 1: Preparing Our Samples for Extraction***

The first thing we did was transfer the filters from the storage tubes to the bead-beating tubes provided by Qiagen.

*A rolled up filter:*

***Step 2: Vortex the Samples***  

Upon micropipetting lysing buffer into the sample tubes, the tubes were then vortexed to lyse the cells and remove the DNA from the filter.

***Step 3: Transferring Samples***  

At this point, our DNA was in the buffer and no longer on the filter. Therefore, we pipetted off the buffer (containing our DNA) and transferred it into a new tube.

*Transferring the Sample:*

***Step 4: Removing Remaining Beads***  

Upon transferring the buffer containing our DNA, we then used the centrifuge to spin down the remaining beads that were transferred alongside our sample.

*Samples with spun down beads:*

***Step 4: Removal of Inhibitors***    

To ensure proper removal of inhibitory proteins and cell debris, a reagent was added to the sample. The sample was then vortexed, incubated at a cold temperature, and spun down with the centrifuge. This time around, the pellet at the bottom of the tube upon vortexing was the unwanted cell debris and proteins - both items that could have been detrimental as we continued with our experiment.

*Pipetting in the reagent:*

***Step 5: Wash and Repeat***    

The next step was to add a reagent to the sample that allows the sample to bind to the surface of the column. This was then loaded into the column, and the samples were spun down in the centrifuge - causing the buffer to flow through the column and the DNA to remain on the surface of the column. Once the DNA was on the column, it was washed by filling the column with wash buffers and spinning it down, having the wash buffers flow through the column while the DNA continued to remain on the column.

*Adding binding buffer to the DNA sample:*

***STEP 6: Elute the DNA***

The last step of the extraction! For the final step, we added elution buffer to the column. This buffer bound to the DNA, so when we once again centrifuged the samples, the elution buffer containing the DNA flowed through the column. The end result was a microcentrifuge tube containing 100uL of elution buffer containing our DNA.

***CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE***

Time to check your knowledge! Where was your DNA at the beginning of the extraction process, and where is it now?

**A.** It started out on the filter, and now it is stuck on the beads.

**B.** It started out on the filter, and now it is in the garbage

**C.** It started out on the filter, and now it is in the elution buffer
