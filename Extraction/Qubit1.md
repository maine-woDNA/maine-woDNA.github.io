**Qubitting Our eDNA Samples**

Once we had extracted our eDNA, we then had to qubit our samples to quantify our DNA concentrations. 

To do this we followed these steps:


***Step 1: Plan Concentrations***

***Step 3: Make Qubit Standard***

***Step 6:Reading Qubit Results***

***CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE***

Time to check your knowledge! What is the standard (is this what it's called Rene?) used for in qubiting?

**A.** To calibrate the qubit machine.

**B.** To act as a negative control.

**C.** To clean the qubit machine before use.
