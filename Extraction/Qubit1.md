**Qubitting Our eDNA Samples**

The qubit is an instrument that quantifies the concentration of DNA in the sample. 2 microliters of the sample are added to a buffer that has a fluorescent dye in it. This dye binds to all DNA present in the sample. Therefore, by measuring the amount of fluorescence in the sample, the concentration of DNA can be determined. 

To do this we followed these steps:

***Step 1: Plan Concentrations***  

The first step is to calculate how much buffer and fluorescent dye is needed to properly measure the concentration of DNA

***Step 2: Allocating out Buffer & DNA***

Next, we added fluorescent dye to the buffer, allocated the mixed buffer to each qubit tube, and added DNA from each sample to it's corresponding tube.

***Step 3:Reading Qubit Results***

Each tube is vortexed before being placed in the qubit instrument. Prior to measuring the samples, standards are run to create a standard curve. Once the curve has been determined, each sample is placed in the qubit instrument one at a time, and the concentrations are calculated.

***CHECK YOUR KNOWLEDGE***

Time to check your knowledge! How does the qubit calculate the concentration of DNA?

**A.** By measuring the amount of fluorescence in the sample.

**B.** Little science fairies count each strand of DNA in the sample.

**C.** It uses it's fine scale and measures the weight of the sample.
