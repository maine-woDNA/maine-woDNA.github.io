Can i just add some content below the image? Maybe some buttons? Or leave it blank so you have to navigate from the nav bar
Back to article, adding text to verify if it worked. Added full path of background image as well? i would like to see it appear...

<!-- note: potentially change this to landing theme instead of article?-->

<!-- <div class="layout--home">

</div>
<script>
  {%- include scripts/home.js -%}
