## Who (or what) is woDNA?

woDNA is made up of 4 AWESOME ladies who are interested in exploring eDNA science. Our diverse backgrounds (marine science, molecular biology, ecology and environmental science, and communication and journalism) give us flexibility in that we need not be an expert in all things. As team, we rely on each other to lead with personal knowledge and expertise and we have robust conversations, laugh a lot, ask questions, keep an open mind to change, learn from each other, and seek advice from others outside of our team when we're stumped. Early on in our work together we realized that often it was easier to explain our ideas by creating visual diagrams. By sharing our research process it is our hope that we can train, educate, and inspire students and the community at large to be curious about our world, how it is changing, and why it matters.

|Jennifer Smith-Mayo (Jen) is a Communication Ph.D. student at the University of Maine in Orono, Maine. Her advisors are Dr. Bridie McGreavy, Associate Professor of the Department of Communication and Journalism, and Dr. Heather Leslie, Associate Professor of the School of Marine Sciences. Jen’s research areas of interest are science communication, visual communication, and rhetoric. She’s also curious how immersive technology (e.g., an underwater drone or GoPro) and storytelling may offer ways for communities to engage more deeply with the environment, especially our streams, lakes, and oceans. Jen has an extensive background as a photographer and videographer and she lives in Maine with her husband, author Matthew P. Mayo, and their pup, Miss Tess.|Rene Francolini is a PhD student jointly advised by Damian Brady at University of Maine’s Darling Marine Center and Doug Rasher at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. Rene earned her B.S. in Biological Sciences as well as her M.S. in Computational Biology from Carnegie Mellon University. Rene is interested in the impact that climate change has on our coastal environments – particularly on the kelp forests of the Gulf of Maine. Combining field work, computer science, and laboratory work, she is investigating the how the kelp forests and associated ecosystem are adapting and responding to our changing climate. When not in the lab, you can find her enjoying time out in nature, gardening, searching for horseshoe crabs, or baking intricately designed (and sometimes science themed) baked goods! |

|Sarah Risley is a dual-degree Marine Biology & Marine Policy student at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center. She is jointly advised by Dr. Heather Leslie, Professor of the School of Marine Science, and Dr. Joshua Stoll, Associate Professor of the School of Marine Sciences. Sarah's research explores how and why Maine’s intertidal shellfisheries and estuarine ecosystems are changing through time. Broadly, she is interested in studying small-scale fisheries and how they can support resilient coastal communities and food systems. When not doing research, Sarah enjoys hiking Maine's mountains and coasts, reading tons of fiction, and doing all forms of making, generally of the sewing, building, and painting ilk. |Phoebe is currently pursuing her PhD with Drs. Heather Leslie (UMaine) and Nichole Price (Bigelow) as part of the Maine eDNA program. Her work includes development of eDNA tools to monitor reproduction and recruitment processes in aquaculture and wild shellfisheries. Phoebe is also the Director of Research for the Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership whose mission is to integrate science education, applied research, and leadership development through year-round educational programs. When her brain isn't working her brain is playing doing ANYTHING outside, being underwater, playing hockey, chatting with anyone, and snuggling her cats Adventure Cat and Danger Cat (AC and DC). |
