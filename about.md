Edit this page by going to about.md. Im thinking we can give background on this project right here and who we are? We can also turn those topics onto different pages if we wanted to!


## Who (or what) is woDNA?

woDNA is composed of 4 AWESOME ladies. we can have photos of us and a little blurb about us if we wanted to. I am leaving some theme example photos below since we can do something similar with images of us, but we can also do it formatted differently.

|Jennifer Smith-Mayo (Jen) is a Communication Ph.D. student at the University of Maine in Orono, Maine. Her advisors are Dr. Bridie McGreavy, Associate Professor of the Department of Communication and Journalism, and Dr. Heather Leslie, Associate Professor of the School of Marine Sciences. Jen’s research areas of interest are science communication, visual communication, and rhetoric. She’s also curious how immersive technology (e.g., an underwater drone or GoPro) and storytelling may offer ways for communities to engage more deeply with the environment, especially our streams, lakes, and oceans. Jen has an extensive background as a photographer and videographer and she lives in Maine with her husband, author Matthew P. Mayo, and their pup, Miss Tess.| |

| Rene is a PhD student jointly advised by Damian Brady at University of Maine’s Darling Marine Center and Doug Rasher at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. Rene earned her B.S. in Biological Sciences as well as her M.S. in Computational Biology from Carnegie Mellon University. Rene is interested in the impact that climate change has on our coastal environments – particularly on the kelp forests of the Gulf of Maine. Combining field work, computer science, and laboratory work, she is investigating the how the kelp forests and associated ecosystem are adapting and responding to our changing climate. When not in the lab, you can find her enjoying time out in nature, gardening, searching for horseshoe crabs, or baking intricately designed (and sometimes science themed) baked goods! | |
